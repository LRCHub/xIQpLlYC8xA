Hey, Em, it's Paul
Uh, I was listening to the album
Good fucking luck, you're
on your own
Guess who's back, back again?
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?
(Haha)
Da-da-da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da-da-da, da, da, da, da
Well, look what the stork brung
(What?)
Little baby devil with
the forked tongue
And it's stickin' out,
yeah, like a sore thumb
(Bleh)
With a forehead that it
grew horns from
(Look)
Still a white jerk
(It's him)
pullin' up in a Chrysler
to the cypher
With the Vics, Percs and a
Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician
(Yeah)
an electrician
(Yeah)
Y'all light work
(Haha)
And I don't gotta play
pretend, it's you I
make believe
(What?)
And you know I'm here to
stay 'cause me
(Why?)
If I was to ever take a leave
(What?)
It would be aspirin' to break
a feve'
(Yeah)
If I was to ask for Megan Thee
(What?)
Stallion if she would
collab with me
Would I really have a shot at
a feat?
(Haha)
I don't know, but I'm glad to
be back like
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my
bag, bruh
(Like)
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro
Now, back in the days of old me
(When?)
Right around the time I became
a dope fiend
(Oh)
Ate some codeine as a way
of coping
(Mm)
Taste of opiates, case of O.E.
Turned me into smiley face
emoji
(Woo)
My shit may not
be age-appropriate
But I will hit an
eight-year-old in the face
with a participation trophy
'Cause I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout
To turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out to
(Shut me down)
So when I started this verse
It did start off lighthearted
at first
(Hmm)
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind-bogglin' how my profit
has skyrocketed
Look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just
like y'all had been
light joggin', and
I've been runnin' at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like
my noggin', and
I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the
best, but opps, I'm
white chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock
it then
"Oh my God, it's him!
Not again!"
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my
bag, bruh
(Like)
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back,
bro
(Break it down)
Sometimes, I wonder what the
old me'd say
(If what?)
If he could see the way shit
is today
(Look at this shit, man)
He'd probably say
that everything is gay
(Like happy)
What's my name? What's my name?
(Slim Shady)
So how many little kids
still wanna act like me?
(Haha)
I'm a bigger prick than cacti
be
(Yeah)
And that's why these
(What?)
Words sting just like you
were being attacked by bees
(Bzz)
In the coupe, leaning back
my seat
(What?)
Bumpin' R. Kelly's
favorite group
(Uh)
the black guy
(Guy)
pees
(Pees, haha)
In my Air Max 90s
White Ts, walkin'
parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese
(Why?)
Identifies as black, but
acts Chinese
(Haha)
Like a motherfuckin' Hacky
Sack, I treat
(What?)
The whole world 'cause I got
it at my feet
(Yeah)
How can I explain to you
(What?)
That even myself I'm a
danger to?
(Yeah)
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two
to anger you
But fuck that, if I think
that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me, what? Okay, that's it
Go ahead, Paul, quit,
snake-ass prick
You male cross dresser
(Haha)
fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit
for that
(Watch)
But you can all suck my dick,
in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck
Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you
Fuck my own kids, they're brats
(Fuck 'em)
They can screw off
(Yeah)
them and you all
(Uh)
You too, Paul
(Punk)
got two balls
Big as RuPaul's
(Woah)
What you thought you saw
ain't what you saw
(Nah)
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see
the kidnappin' never did happen
Like Sherri Papini,
Harry Houdini
I vanish into the thin air
as I'm leavin' like
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my
bag, bruh
(Like)
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro
