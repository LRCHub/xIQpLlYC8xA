I didn't know reality
I couldn't tell what
I could see
The speed of time
Is shaking me
Your eyes are framing
All my mind
I'm losing you

I didn't know reality
I couldn't tell what
I could see
The speed of time
Is shaking me
Your eyes are framing
All my mind
I'm losing you

Don't you ever leave my mind

The streets are fading
Come and go
I'm running and I'm feeling low
I'm walking like a living dead
A burning heart just drives me mad
Where are you

I didn't know reality
I couldn't tell what
I could see
The speed of time
Is shaking me
Your eyes are framing
All my mind
I'm losing you

I didn't know reality
I couldn't tell what
I could see
The speed of time
Is shaking me
Your eyes are framing
All my mind
I'm losing you

I didn't know reality
I couldn't tell what
I could see
The speed of time
Is shaking me
Your eyes are framing
All my mind
I'm losing you

I didn't know reality
I couldn't tell what
I could see
The speed of time
Is shaking me
Your eyes are framing
All my mind
I'm losing you

I didn't know reality
I couldn't tell what
I could see
The speed of time
Is shaking me
Your eyes are framing
All my mind
I'm losing you

I didn't know reality
I couldn't tell what
I could see
The speed of time
Is shaking me
Your eyes are framing
All my mind
I'm losing you

Don't you ever leave my mind
Don't you ever leave my mind
Don't you ever leave my mind
