All dressed up
And nowhere to go
I think I'm taking this trip alone
Thirty seconds till I pass
The questions you will never ask
Your regrets will haunt you
You know I never had to
But I'm saving myself
From you
And did you notice anything?
The changes made
And now it's safe to say
You will never change your ways
I went to your house
But you weren't home
I'm sure you conveniently shut off your phone
I don't think that I'll ever be
The person that you want of me
When all that I can think about
It's you I have to figure out
But I'm saving myself
From you
Did you notice anything?
The changes made
Now it's safe to say
You will never change your ways
You would give up anything
To prove your point
There's nothing left to say
You will never change your ways
(Rip it up)
I'm saving myself
From you
Yeah, I'm saving myself
From you
All dressed up
And nowhere to go
I think I'm taking this trip alone
Did you notice anything?
The changes made
Now it's safe to say
You will never change your ways
You would give up anything
To prove your point
There's nothing left to say
You will never change your ways
